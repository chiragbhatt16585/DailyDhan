          <p>
            Welcome to <strong>DailyDhan</strong>. These Terms &amp; Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;)
            govern your use of the DailyDhan mobile application and this website
            <strong>DailyDhan.in</strong> (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;). By using the
            Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
          <p>
            DailyDhan is a personal finance tracking tool that allows you to record income,
            expenses, categories and view reports such as monthly income vs expense and
            category‑wise summaries. The Service is provided for personal, non‑commercial use only,
            unless otherwise agreed in writing.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            The app primarily stores your financial entries locally on your device using a secure
            database. You are responsible for:
          </p>
          <ul class="dd-list">
            <li>Keeping your device secure and backed up.</li>
            <li>Checking your records for accuracy and completeness.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for any loss of data caused by device issues, uninstalling the
            app, clearing app data, or other factors outside our control.
          </p>

          <h2>3. No Financial Advice</h2>
          <p>
            DailyDhan does <strong>not</strong> provide financial, investment, tax, or legal
            advice. All charts, summaries and reports are informational only. You should consult a
            qualified professional before making financial decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Affiliate Links &amp; Advertising</h2>
          <p>
            DailyDhan may display banner ads and affiliate links (for example, links to online
            shopping sites such as Amazon, Flipkart, etc.). When you click these links and make a
            purchase, we may earn a small commission. This helps us keep the app free for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prices, availability and any offers shown via affiliate links are controlled by the
            respective third‑party websites. We are not responsible for:
          </p>
          <ul class="dd-list">
            <li>Product quality, delivery or customer service.</li>
            <li>Any disputes between you and the third‑party seller.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            The app may use third‑party services such as analytics, crash reporting, and advertising
            platforms (for example, Google AdMob). Your use of those services is subject to their
            own terms and privacy policies.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul class="dd-list">
            <li>Reverse engineer, modify, or attempt to bypass security of the app.</li>
            <li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
            <li>Upload or enter any data that is harmful, offensive, or violates any law.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis
            without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not guarantee that the
            app will be error‑free, uninterrupted, or that any defects will be corrected.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, DailyDhan and its owners shall not be liable for
            any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising from your use
            of the Service, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business
            interruption.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update the app, website, or these Terms from time to time. When we make material
            changes, we will update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date above. Your continued use of
            the Service after any changes means you accept the updated Terms.
          </p>
